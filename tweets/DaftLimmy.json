  "tweets": "On Radio Scotland in a few minutes. Drawn spirals? 👍🏻 Never. I start building at the centre and use the map. Playing Lego Worlds. I'll tell you why Minecraft is better. With Minecraft, you create a world, name it, and there it is, easy to save and load, there it is. With Lego Worlds, you don't know where the fuck it is. \"ad\" as they say. Action has been taken. This time themorra (10pm, Thursday), Limmy's Homemade Show will be on BBC Two Scotland, and the rest of the UK on the iPlayer! Smiling mouth, sad eyes. Hiding the pain. Should I sometimes change the charity do tweet? Hey guys, Brian Limond here, brand manager of Limmy. We thought we'd shake up the charity tweet for Ray Wilkins by doing a mash up with the \"Good Rangers man, good Sellick man\" Limmy banter. It has proven to be unpopular with our fans. We have listened. Thank you. Such an awkward moment. You've got a big week ahead. He's flying. I'll leave him here. Had the pleasure of meeting Ray Wilkins at a charity do once. Good Rangers man. Okay. I see. Nae borra. Here's a pic to use. \"He see-sawed his balls against my hand\" - alleges Limmy's Show co-star. 👍🏻 Total accident. Christ, cannae believe I dropped myself in it like that. Hope you're well, and we'll meet at Wells as well, that's what we'll do. Well, I'm away to buy a pair of wellies, and some whelks. if you then you don't don't love deserve me at my me at my What the fuck are you talking about? Where did this all come from? Just asked if you were coming to the Wells... oh. Oh fuck, mate, I'm so sorry. Awright, mate? You coming to my Vines thing in Somerset? It's at a comedy festival. Hope you drop by. 👍🏻 Ta! I can confirm that Limmy's Homemade Show will be HD on the iPlayer after broadcast. A lot to unpack here. Let me unpack me then unpack you then unpack us. It's got a right American emotionally distant way to it. Same with \"I'm still processing it\". Psychiatrist patter. Visual metaphors. Aye. I'm still processing the unpacking. \"My mother died over a year ago and I know I should have confronted that by now, but I'm just not ready to unpack that yet\" \"Unpack\". That's a new one.\"I've just read this article, I'd like to unpack a few of the claims\" This is the right idea. BBC Two Scotland isnae HD, does anybody know if the live broadcast on the iPlayer is HD? Two days till Limmy's Homemade Show! This is from my private photo album, please delete. Limmy's Homemade Show, this Thursday, 10pm, BBC Two Scotland. For folk outside Scotland, it'll be live on iPlayer! A fan of that techno tune before the thing's on the telly. 👍🏻"
